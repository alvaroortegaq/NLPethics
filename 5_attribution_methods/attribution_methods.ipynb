        "Findings:\n",
        "* As we know, the original model performs well (>95% accuracy) on matching scenarios, and indeed outputs a higher utility for the scenario in the pair which was classified as better for the example below.\n",
        "* The visualization shows the kinds of words and phrases which lead to a more positive overall utility (e.g. \"for my annual Christmas Party\", \"I won\", \"rock concert\") and a more negative overall utility (e.g. \"I lost\", \"I didn't look forward to\").\n",
        "* On the other hand, the unmatched scenario pair visualization confirms that the model is poorly calibrated for unmatched scenarios. For example, the scenario \"I got the best grades in my high school.\" is given a smaller utility than the scenario \"I saw a vending machine on the corner. The sodas in the machine were cheaper than in the other machines.\", which seems inconsistent with a reasonable utilitarian framework. This suggests training on unmatched scenario pairs, as the original model did not do so, and/or using an improved Learning to Rank (LtR) algorithm for training, such as LambdaRank ([Burges, Ragno, and Le, 2006](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/lambdarank.pdf)).\n",
        "* These visualizations also easily expose other flaws in the model, such as that the length of a scenario matters for the utility output, as having more words leads to more opportunity to force the utility in a positive or negative direction. Additionally, ungrammatical scenarios, e.g. swapping “Christmas” for “Christmas Christmas Christmas” in the example below leads to a greater utility. This suggests that the model should be able to account for scenario length, and have the ability to reject meaningless scenarios, as the original paper suggests.\n",
        "* Overall SHAP seems like a more useful tool than BertViz for our use case. In future, it would be interesting to investigate training a model to output textual reasoning along with its utility."
